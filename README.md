The structure is quiet straightforward. It is composed of one back-end and one front-end. Each folder has its own readme file to explain how to install and run the back/front. 

## Getting Started

First run the back-end and then run the front-end. In each case, follow the readme file instructions. 

### Prerequisites

The application needs the following to work:

```
npm
node
mongoDB
```
